This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust: attempting to create multiple mutable borrows of the same variable.  The `bug.rs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version.  Rust's borrowing system prevents data races by ensuring that only one mutable reference or multiple immutable references can exist at any given time. This example highlights the importance of understanding Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
